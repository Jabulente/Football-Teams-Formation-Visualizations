# Football Teams Formation Visualizations

This project provides visual representations of football (soccer) team formations using Python and Matplotlib. It helps coaches, analysts, and fans easily understand how teams are structured on the field during a match.

## Project Overview

Formations such as **4-3-3**, **4-4-2**, **3-5-2**, and others can be plotted visually to represent player positions on the pitch. This tool uses Matplotlib to draw a football pitch and overlay player positions in a chosen formation.

## Features

* Visualizes popular football formations
* Customizable team and player names
* Clean and clear soccer field design
* Easily extendable for tactics and strategy demonstrations

## Example Output

Sample formation visualization (e.g., 4-3-3):

```
Goalkeeper
Defenders (4)
Midfielders (3)
Forwards (3)
```

\[Insert a screenshot or saved image of a sample plot here, if available.]

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Football-Teams-Formation-Visualizations.git
   cd Football-Teams-Formation-Visualizations
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python formation_plotter.py
   ```

4. Follow on-screen instructions or edit the script to define the formation you want to visualize.

## Customization

You can modify:

* Player names
* Player positions
* Team formation styles
* Colors and aesthetics of the pitch

## Example Formation Dictionary

```python
formation_433 = {
    'Goalkeeper': [(5, 1)],
    'Defenders': [(1, 3), (3, 3), (7, 3), (9, 3)],
    'Midfielders': [(3, 5), (5, 6), (7, 5)],
    'Forwards': [(2, 8), (5, 9), (8, 8)]
}
```
